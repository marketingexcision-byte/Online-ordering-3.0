ContactAt Excision we are dedicated to analyse each customers production process in detail. Understanding and knowing your needs allows us to offer the right technical solution. We carry out an exhaustive data collection to understand your processes and particularities and therefore avoid possible subsequent problems such as downtimes or parts rejection. A correct study is key to obtain the best results.2. Value proposalWe recommend the most suitable solution, taking into account the needs of each client, their goals and the results obtained during the first phase. Each client is different, and each situation is unique, that is why our R&D department modifies our formulas until we find the product that best suits the needs of each client and that offers the best results.3. Start upThe suppliers involvement in the product testing and demonstration phase is very important. For this reason, in addition to making on-site formulation adjustments, we also carry out training sessions to all the people who will be involved in the use and maintenance of the product, both to transmit the necessary knowledge of handling and functionality, and to train them in occupational and environmental safety.4. MonitoringOne of our main differentiating factors is the constant monitoring and control of the projects we carry out. Our units all over Australia allow us to provide our clients with close and constant support and advice, both to avoid possible unforeseen events and to correct them immediately.5. PartnershipOur partnership capabilities extend beyond product sales. We provide global lubricant management services (Global Chemical Management) to optimise the daily management of a plant. We also advise and help implement solutions for the recovery and reuse of used products, as well as for the management and treatment of waste.Einfo@excision.com.auT+61 3 5551 4555 5'","6":"b'Coolants6 www.excision.com.au'","7":"b'Metal Working FluidsCoolant Comparison TableLegend:Good+BetterBest+ Type Lubrication Dragout CoolingTool life Corrosion WaterPower performance protection hardness rangeXDP1000 Soluble  + +  +\/ 50-600 ppmXDP1400 Soluble + + + +  50-300 ppmXDP2000 Semi- +   + + 50-300 Synthetic ppmXDP2100 Semi- +   + + 50-600 Synthetic ppmXDP2400 Semi-  + + + + 50-500 Synthetic ppmXDP3000 Synthetic  + +  + 50-1000 ppmXDP3200 Synthetic  + +  + 50-1000 ppmXDP3500 Synthetic + + + +  50-1000 ppmXDP3800 Synthetic + + + + + 50-800 ppm Einfo@excision.com.auT+61 3 5551 4555 7'","8":"b'Metal Working FluidsThe Excision 1L SystemA unique concept developed to save money, time and wastage1 Litre pouch of coolant that is pre-measured, so all you have to do is add to 20 litres of waterAn economical coolant for use in a wide An enhanced coolant developed fromrange of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. a formula to extend tool Life.8 www.excision.com.au'","9":"b'Metal Working FluidsXDP1000 Mineral CoolantSoluble concentrate for general machiningXDP1000 is a water-miscible cutting fluid with high lubricating and cooling properties based on refined mineral oil, anti-wear and anti-oxidant additives.Thanks to its high oil content, it obtains a very good surface finish of parts and a long life of the tool.XDP1000 is a cutting fluid that is suitable formachining metals such as steel, copper, brass andtheir alloys.It can be used in a wide range of water hardness between 50 and 500 ppm CaCO3.XDP1000 is a soluble oil free from chlorinated derivatives, boron, amines, nitrites or Sulphurs.
