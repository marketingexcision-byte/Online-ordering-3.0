Bimetal Bandsaw Blade Run In ProcedureThe life of an Excision Bi-Alfa bimetal bandsaw blade can be increased significantly by following the recommended running-in procedure. A new blade benefits from a short period of cutting at reduced cutting feed rate. Use normal recommended band speed and reduce feed pressure by 50%. After approximately 500cm of cross sectional area or 15 minutes has been sawn, the feed rate should be gradually increased to maximum. The best material to run-in an Excision blade is round mild steel bar, about 80mm diameter, depending on the tooth pitch.Highly recommended to increase blade lifeBlade Weld Tester, for a quality weld assurance in every blade.30 www.excision.com.au Einfo@excision.com.au 31T+61 3 5551 4555'", "32": "b'Bandsaw BladesMetal Cutting Technical Information Tooth SelectionFor metal cutting bandsaw bladesSolidsVari-Pitch Toothing TCT Toothing (Materials over 50 HRc)Material Diameter (D) mm Teeth Per Inch Material Diameter (D) mm Teeth Per Inch0-5 18 50-120 3/44-8 14 100-250 2/32-15 10/14 150-400 1.5/28-20 8/12 350-600 1.1/1.616-30 6/10 500+ 0.85/1.1525-40 5/835-70 4/660-120 3/480-200 2/3120-400 1.5/2250+ 1.1/1.6400+ 0.75/1.25Normal ToothTubes and RHSTube Width (W) mm Wall Thickness (T)1 1.6 2 2.5 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 20 5010 14 10/14 10/1420 14 10/14 10/14 10/14 8/1225 14 10/14 10/14 10/14 8/12 8/1230 14 10/14 10/14 10/14 8/12 8/12 6/1040 14 10/14 10/14 10/14 8/12 8/12 6/10 5/8 5/8 5/850 14 10/14 10/14 8/12 8/12 6/10 6/10 5/8 5/8 5/860-120 14 10/14 10/14 8/12 8/12 6/10 6/10 5/8 5/8 4/6 4/6 4/6 4/6 3/4 3/4130-150 10/14 10/14 8/12 8/12 6/10 6/10 5/8 5/8 4/6 4/6 4/6 4/6 3/4 3/4 3/4150-180 10/14 8/12 6/10 6/10 5/8 4/6 4/6 4/6 4/6 4/6 4/6 3/4 3/4 3/4190-300 6/10 6/10 5/8 4/6 4/6 4/6 4/6 4/6 4/6 3/4 3/4 2/3350-400 4/6 4/6 3/4 3/4 3/4 3/4 2/3450-500 4/6 4/6 3/4 3/4 3/4 3/4 2/332 www.excision.com.au Einfo@excision.com.au 33T+61 3 5551 4555'", "33": "b'Bandsaw BladesMetal Cutting Technical InformationNormal ToothUniversal Beam0 Saw Angle Universal Beam5 Saw AngleBeam Size (H) Wall Thickness (F) Beam Size (H) Wall Thickness (F)7 8 9 10 12 14 16 20 7 8 9 10 12 14 16 20150 6/10 4/6 4/6 150 5/7 5/7 5/7180 4/6 4/6 4/6 180 5/7 5/7 5/7200 3/4 3/4 3/4 200 4/6 4/6 4/6250 3/4 3/4 3/4 250 4/6 4/6 4/6310 2/3 2/3 2/3 310 4/6 4/6 4/6360 2/3 2/3 2/3 360 4/6 4/6 4/6410 2/3 2/3 2/3 410 4/6 4/6 4/6460 2/3 2/3 2/3 460 4/6 4/6 4/6530 2/3 2/3 2/3 530 4/6 4/6 4/6610 1.5/2 1.5/2 1.5/2 610 3/4 3/4 3/4Profile ToothBundle Cut Tubes and RHSTube Width (W) mm Wall Thickness (T)1 1.6 2 2.5 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 20 5010 14 8/11 8/1120 14 8/11 8/11 8/11 8/1125 14 8/11 8/11 8/11 8/11 8/1130 14 8/11 8/11 8/11 8/11 5/7 5/740 10/14 8/11 8/11 8/11 8/11 5/7 5/7 5/7 4/6 4/650 10/14 8/11 8/11 8/11 5/7 5/7 5/7 5/7 4/6 4/660-120 10/14 8/11 8/11 8/11 5/7 5/7 5/7 4/6 4/6 4/6 3/4 3/4 3/4 3/4 3/4130-150 8/11 8/11 8/11 5/7 5/7 4/6 4/6 4/6 4/6 3/4 3/4 3/4 3/4 2/3 2/3150-180 8/11 8/11 5/7 5/7 4/6 4/6 4/6 3/4 3/4 3/4 3/4 2/3 2/3 2/3190-300 5/7 5/7 4/6 4/6 4/6 3/4 3/4 3/4 3/4 2/3 2/3 1.5/2350-400 4/6 3/4 3/4 3/4 2/3 2/3 2/3 1.5/2450-500 3/4 3/4 3/4 2/3 2/3 2/3 2/3 1.5/2Profile ToothUniversal Beam0 Saw Angle Universal Beam0 Saw AngleBeam Size (H) Wall Thickness (F) Beam Size (H) Wall Thickness (F)7 8 9 10 12 14 16 20 7 8 9 10 12 14 16 20150 4/6 4/6 4/6 150 4/6 4/6 4/6180 3/4 3/4 3/4 180 3/4 3/4 3/4200 3/4 3/4 3/4 200 3/4 3/4 3/4250 2/3 2/3 2/3 250 2/3 2/3 2/3310 2/3 2/3 2/3 310 2/3 2/3 2/3360 2/3 2/3 2/3 360 2/3 2/3 2/3410 2/3 2/3 2/3 410 2/3 2/3 2/3460 2/3 2/3 2/3 460 2/3 2/3 2/3530 1.5/2 1.5/2 1.5/2 530 1.5/2 1.5/2 1.5/2610 1.5/2 1.5/2 1.5/2 610 1.5/2 1.5/2 1.5/232 www.excision.com.au Einfo@excision.com.au 33T+61 3 5551 4555'", "34": "b'Bandsaw BladesMetal Cutting Technical Information Sawing Basic TroubleshootingFeed RateFeed rate too light Feed rate too heavy Recommended feed rateRubs the toothPremature tooth wear Optimum lifedull Teeth wear too fast and break offNumber of Teeth in Band Guide ArmsToo few teeth - toothGuide arms should be as close to the straddle (of workpiece) work as possible and secure firmlythis causes tooth strippage.Too many teeth - chip loading of bandsaw blade gullet, this causes tooth strippage.a.The tooth cuts a chip which fills the gulletb.When the gullet is full, pressure is created.c.When the pressure is not relieved, the resultsis a crooked cut, stripped teeth or both.Brushes Coolant TensionBrushes aid in the cleaningShould Wash, Cool,Ensure correct tension. of chips from the gullet ofLubricate the blade as wellTension to 300N/mm2.

Tip: For contour cutting (cutting curves), the blade should be as wide as the machine permits, but still narrow enough so that it can cut the desired shape (radius). Teeth Per InchThe number of teeth per inch (TPI) defines the pitch of the blade and can vary from 1 to 32 TPI. On some bandsaw blades there are different pitches on the same blade referred to as Vari-Pitch. You must select the correct TPI for the thickness of material you are cutting.

They will reduce your costs and increase your speed and performance.Recommended for use with the following materials:Hardened & case hardened SteelMild steels & regular metalsBisalloyStainless SteelSteel Castings104 www.excision.com.au Einfo@excision.com.au 105T+61 3 5551 4555'", "105": "b'Core Drills TCT Core Drills35mm depthDiameter Code Diameter Code Diameter Code12 2005012035 22 1905012035 32 190501203513 1905013035 23 1905013035 33 190501303514 1905014035 24 1905014035 34 190501403515 1905015035 25 1905015035 35 190501503516 1905016035 26 1905016035 36 190501603517 1905017035 27 1905017035 37 190501703518 1905018035 28 1905018035 38 190501803519 1905019035 29 1905019035 39 190501903520 1905020035 30 1905020035 40 190502003521 1905021035 31 190502103550mm depthDiameter Code Diameter Code Diameter Code12 2005012035 33 2005033050 54 200505405013 2005013050 34 2005034050 55 200505505014 2005014050 35 2005035050 56 200505605015 2005015050 36 2005036050 57 200505705016 2005016050 37 2005037050 58 200505805017 1905017050 38 2005038050 59 200505905018 1905018050 39 2005039050 60 200506005019 1905019050 40 2005040050 61 200506105020 1905020050 41 2005041050 62 200506205021 1905021050 42 2005042050 63 200506305022 2005022050 43 2005043050 64 200506405023 2005023050 44 2005044050 65 200506505024 2005024050 45 2005045050 66 200506605025 2005025050 46 2005046050 67 200506705026 2005026050 47 2005047050 68 2005068050 Diameter Code27 2005027050 48 2005048050 69 2005069050 75 200507505028 2005028050 49 2005049050 70 2005070050 76 200507605029 2005029050 50 2005050050 71 2005071050 77 200507705030 2005030050 51 2005051050 72 2005072050 78 200507805031 2005031050 52 2005052050 73 2005073050 79 200507905032 2005032050 53 2005053050 74 2005074050 80 2005080050104 www.excision.com.au Einfo@excision.com.au 105T+61 3 5551 4555'", "106": "b'Core Drills TCT Core Drills75mm depthDiameter Code Diameter Code Diameter Code14 2005014075 37 2005037075 60 200506007515 2005015075 38 2005038075 61 200506107516 2005016075 39 2005039075 62 200506207517 2005017075 40 2005040075 63 200506307518 2005018075 41 2005041075 64 200506407519 2005019075 42 2005042075 65 200506507520 2005020075 43 2005043075 66 200506607521 2005021075 44 2005044075 67 200506707522 2005022075 45 2005045075 68 200506807523 2005023075 46 2005046075 69 200506907524 2005024075 47 2005047075 70 200507007525 2005025075 48 2005048075 71 200507107526 2005026075 49 2005049075 72 200507207527 2005027075 50 2005050075 73 200507307528 2005028075 51 2005051075 74 200507407529 2005029075 52 2005052075 75 200507507530 2005030075 53 2005053075 76 200507607531 2005031075 54 2005054075 77 200507707532 2005032075 55 2005055075 78 200507807533 2005033075 56 2005056075 79 200507907534 2005034075 57 2005057075 80 200508007535 2005035075 58 200505807536 2005036075 59 2005059075RecommendedXDP905 FoamUse XDP905 Foam for longer life.Refer to Page 62.106 www.excision.com.au Einfo@excision.com.au 107T+61 3 5551 4555'", "107": "b'Core Drills TCT Core Drills100mm depthDepth of cut 100mmTungsten Carbide Tips for harder metals and faster drillingUniversal Shank (19mm) for all magnetic drillsDiameter Code Diameter Code Diameter Code18 2005018100 49 2005049100 80 200508010019 2005019100 50 2005050100 85 200508510020 2005020100 51 20050511000 90 200509010021 2005021100 52 2005052100 95 200509510022 2005022100 53 2005053100 100 200510010023 2005023100 54 200505410024 2005024100 55 2005055100 Recommended25 2005025100 56 200505610026 2005026100 57 2005057100XDP90527 2005027100 58 200505810028 2005028100 59 2005059100 Use XDP905 paste or 29 2005029100 60 2005060100 spray for longer life.
